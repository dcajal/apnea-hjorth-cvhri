# Apnea detection from PPG and SpO2

Apnea detection from PPG and SpO2 using Hjörth parameters as inputs. MATLAB code for research and validation of the model. It includes classification models for binary (normal/abnormal respiration segments) and multiclass (normal/apneic/hypopneic respiration segments) decisions.

Cyclic Variation of the Heart Rate Index (CVHRI) is measured for each subject and the correlation with the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is computed. CVHRI is defined as the sum of the frequencies of the spectrum peaks between 0 and 0.1 Hz divided by the total number of segments [1].
